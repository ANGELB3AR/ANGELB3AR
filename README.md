- 👋 Hi, my name is Angel
- 👀 I’m interested in game development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity and C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to build my portfolio while I seek my a position as a Game Developer
  - I would ideally like to work for a studio building 3D or VR games as a hybrid employee (I live near Austin, TX).  This is because I would like the opportunity to learn directly from more experienced developers.
  - If you or someone you know is interested in hiring a passionate and dedicated Gameplay Programmer, please feel free to take a look at my [resume](https://mega.nz/file/X3ojzJoK#bOuyNxdY8yTP3RuRf8oJHtgfKL2cEinsSknTYa5QrmQ) and reach out to me

  - Play some of my games and have fun!
